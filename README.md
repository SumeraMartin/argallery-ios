# argallery-ios
Implementation of art gallery application for iOs with integration of augmented reality build on Kenticocloud

How to run:
1. Best works with Xcode 9.2.
1. `pod install` in terminal in project directory.
1. Run on a real device since AR capabilities are not supported in the simulator.

*If you want to run on a device with iOs 12 or higher using Xcode 9.2 [import device support](https://github.com/filsv/iPhoneOSDeviceSupport) for your particular iOs version.*
